So in this project as we were told to find out the following parameter to find out the following:-  


1.  Readability factor

2. 	Average Number of Words Per Sentence	

3. 	Complex Word Count	

4. 	Word Count	

5. 	Syllable Count Per Word	

6. 	Personal Pronouns	

7. 	Average Word Length	

Also in addition to these factors we also have to find these factors:-


Positvity Score

Nagativity Score

Polarity Score

Subjectivity Score

In short, I used BeautifulSoup to extract the heading and the main content of every article.

I had to use Readability library from the python to find out the Gunning FOG Index.

I also used nltk library to create a list of words and sentences.

Had to import re library to use regex expression to filter out personal pronouns from the extracted data.

NOTE : Also please know that all calculations were made using python so they are not in fraction but rounded up to absolute numbers.
